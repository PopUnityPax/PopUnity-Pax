Project Scope Definition
In-Scope (Core MVP – What We're Buildin' First)
PopUnity Pax is a mobile-first communication platform focused on fosterin' global peace through empathy-driven connections. We flip toxic social vibes into unity hubs with real-time, guided interactions. MVP targets youth (18-35), activists, and global users cravin' constructive talks.
Key deliverables:

Unity Pops: Quick, media-rich posts (text, images, short vids) for sharin' peace stories, cultural vibes, or solution ideas. Upvotes via "empathy hearts."
Pax Rooms: Live audio/video discussion circles (real-time via WebSockets) with AI-guided moderation – gentle prompts like "What's one thing you agree on?" to keep it chill.
Unity Matches: AI-powered 1-on-1 or small-group pairing across divides (cultures, views) with icebreaker questions.
Global Pax Board: Interactive world map for pinnin' real peace actions (events, personal wins) – visual motivation.
Core Safety & UX: Basic profiles, restorative reportin' (educate > warn), sentiment analysis for empathy nudges, multi-lang support (DeepL integration).
Tech Foundations: React Native (cross-platform mobile) + Next.js web, Node.js backend, MongoDB/PostgreSQL, scalable hostin' (Vercel/AWS).

Scope includes beta testin' with 1k diverse users, basic analytics (interactions, empathy surveys), and GDPR compliance (CZ base).
Out-of-Scope (Phase 2 or Later – Not in MVP)
To keep MVP lean n' launchable:

Full 3D/AR/VR immersive features (e.g., virtual peace worlds – future Unity 3D tie-in).
Advanced gamification (NFT badges, crypto rewards).
Deep blockchain (transparent mod logs optional later).
Enterprise tools (paid NGO dashboards).
Heavy offline-first for extreme low-connect (basic queuein' only).
Native desktop apps or smartwatch integration.
Built-in payments/monetization beyond premium teases.

Overall Boundaries

Goal: Grassroots peacebuildin' via digital bridges – not a general social network, debate arena, or news feed. Focus on positive, solution-oriented convos.
Timeline: MVP complete Q4 2026 (design Q1-Q2, build Q3, beta Q4).
Budget Fit: €80k-120k total (dev heavy).
Success Metrics: 5k+ users Year 1, 80%+ reportin' empathy growth, 10k+ cross-divide interactions.
