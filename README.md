**Currently in vision & prototype stage** – applying for Unity for Humanity 2026 grant to build the MVP! 🚀

## Why PopUnity Pax? 🔥
In 2026, online hate is everywhere – echo chambers divide us, polarization is up. But what if your feed actually healed instead of hurt?  

PopUnity Pax is the peace-first app:  
- "Pop" quick positive stories & ideas  
- Get matched with peeps from different views for real talks  
- Join live Pax Rooms with gentle AI prompts to keep it chill & empathetic  
- Pin actions on a Global Pax Board to see real-world change  

Aligned with **UN SDG 16** (Peace, Justice & Strong Institutions) – we turn scrolls into bridges, not battles.

## Core Features (MVP Vision)  
1. **Unity Pops** → Short media posts (text, pics, vids) on peace themes – forgiveness wins, cultural shares, solution ideas.  
2. **Pax Rooms** → Live audio/video circles with real-time empathy coaching (AI flags heat, suggests "Share how this feels?").  
3. **Unity Matches** → Smart pairing across cultures/politics – start with icebreakers for safe convos.  
4. **Global Pax Board** → Interactive map of peace actions – pin events, reconciliations, collabs.  

**Future vibes**: Multi-lang translation, offline mode, Pop Challenges (gamified quests), NGO event tools.

## Tech Stack (Planned)  
- **Frontend** → React Native (mobile) + Next.js (web)  
- **Backend** → Node.js + WebSockets for real-time magic  
- **AI** → Hugging Face for sentiment + empathy prompts  
- **Hosting** → Vercel/AWS, scalable global  

## Current Status  
- Early vision document ready (full PDF in /docs)  
- Wireframes & mockups in progress (Figma link coming)  
- Video trailer demo for grant app (1-3 min prototype walkthrough)  
- GitHub repo launching now – open-source core planned!  

## Roadmap  
- Q1-Q2 2026 → Design, prototype, grant push  
- Q3 2026 → MVP build  
- Q4 2026 → Beta launch (invite-only, 1k users)
